# Arduino Traffic Light Simulation ðŸš¦

This project simulates a basic traffic light system using an Arduino Uno and three LEDs: red, yellow, and green.
Each LED turns on for a specific time to mimic real traffic signal behavior.

 Components Used
- 1x Arduino Uno
- 1x Red LED
- 1x Yellow LED
- 1x Green LED
- 3x 470Î© Resistors
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

 How to Use
1. Connect your components based on the diagram.
2. Upload the `traffic_light.ino` sketch to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power on your Arduino â€” the traffic light will cycle automatically.
